This model has 4 spectrometer of 2048 channels with 600mhz of bw.
We save the raw data of 3 ADCs and send the spectrums using the 10GBe
interface.


As receiver we use the x520-DA1 interface. As a driver we use the
ixgbe module (I had some problems when installing it from the 
intel page.. i think could be compatibility problems with the cable,
but using the one that comes with in the apt works).

Either way we need to modify some system parameter to be able to
receive the data using the 10GBe.


Commands:

    sudo ip addr add 192.168.2.10/24 dev enp2s0     ##create interface
    sudo ethtool -A enp2s0 tx off                   ##only if you want to receive
    nc -lvu 192.168.2.10 60000                      #recv the data to see 
                                                    ##if there is any transmition
    sudo ip link set enp2s0 mtu 9000                #enable jumbo frames
    sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=26214400       #increase the kernel buffers
    sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default=26214400   # idem
    sudo ip link set up dev enp2s0                  #bring up the interface
    
    ##the next one is just to save the raw data.. prefeer the python script
    #sudo tcpdump -B 32768 -s 0 -i enp2s0 udp -N --direction in -p -t -w data -U port 60000


Searching, there are more commands to tweak the 10Gb...for ex 
sometimes you have to set the ip tables for ex 
here are some resources I found
