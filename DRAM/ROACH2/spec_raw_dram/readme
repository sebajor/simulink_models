In this model we have a 4 spectrometers with 2048 channels with a 
600 mhz of bandwidth.
We concurrently save 3 channels of the ADC raw data in the dram. Following 
the ideas in the dram_eth model, we use the 1Gbe block to send the 
data outside the FPGA.


note 1: like the PCs are used to handle byte sized words to work with a
4-bit value we generate a C-code to speed the processing (python is 
really slow...)

note 2: to reutilize the dram ring buffer, you could copy the ring subsystem
and use the dram_class.
