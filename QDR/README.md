# QDR models

## Info
The ROACH2 has 4 QDR available and each QDR has 2^19 addresses of 72 bits. Before using the QDR you need to run a calibration script to set the idelay/odelay. For the calibration step you will need the powerpc interface so when using the QDR remember to enable it when compiling.

## TODO
- [x] Basic QDR (read/write from the fpga and r/w from the FPGA).
- [x] QDR counter.
- [ ] QDR transposer.
