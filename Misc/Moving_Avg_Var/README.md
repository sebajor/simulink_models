# Moving Average and Moving Variance on the integrated power

This model calculate the moving average and moving variance over the integrated power.

#Notes
If you want to use the HDL codes in another model, is desirable to know the values range of your signal, ie study the bit range of your signal and set hte parameters of the moving avg/var accordingly.
