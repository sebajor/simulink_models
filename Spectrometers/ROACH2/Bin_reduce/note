This model has a 8192 FFT compiled at 1080MHz.
In parallel we subsample the FFT adding the channels (the power) 
to have a 128 FFT.
To do that we use a custom vector accumulator (the default one doesnt 
have a enable port, suppose a continuum data stream).

There are some restrictions in the vec_acc module, it doesnt handle 
all the accumulation lengths (as ex acc_len=1 doesnt work)
