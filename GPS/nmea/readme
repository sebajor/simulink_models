This model uses some logic to program an ublox, then search for a 
determined pattern in the messages that the gps is broadcasting.

When the message with the time is received, we save the current time 
in a second resolution. To have a subsec resoution we use the PPS 
given by the gps.

NMEA uses a uart like interface, so is easy to connect it.

The model uses the roach2 gpios to make the work, be carefull the 
gpios are 1.5V tolerant so you have to make some voltage translation also
take care with the initialization process.

    gpio0:  PPS
    gpio1:  UART RX     (connect this with TX of the gps)
    gpio2:  UART TX     (connect this with RX, is just to program
                        the gps module if its needed.. now we only
                        program a ublox, if you need to send another
                        command put the hex in gold_hex.mem)



Also I dont know why sysgen doesnt the parameters in the hdl modules
so this example is compiled with CLK_FREQ = 100_000_000; but the best
is change the parameter right into the top level (in this case gps_parser)
and in the configuration file (gps_parse_config) if you need to use 
another freq.
