Some nics are tricky to use.. Typically computers are not set to 
10Gbe networks, so you need to make some tweaks.

In the script init_tge.sh we set a interface in enp2s0 with an ip
192.168.2.10  and make some adjustment in some linux options.
You need to have installed ethtool and obviously you need to have the
right driver for your device. 

Also for the last instruction (setpci) you need to look for the id of the
device (in the code our is 8086:10fbe)
