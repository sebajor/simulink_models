A simple feed-forward network in HDL. 
Each module has a basic cocotb testbench to check functionality,
but at this moment it doesnt have a rigorous verification.
ie dont use it without testing! 

By the way, I think that this could be easilly done in hls, but I wanted to
make my own implementation in verilog :P
