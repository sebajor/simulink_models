Important!! I only check the functionality of the modules in simple tests
For ex the macc has an error approx 0.002 but i didnt check if its the 
intermediate resizing, the mult or addition or if 
the error is consistent with the quantization.
I do not recommend using this modules in a system that requires a high
precission without re-checking them.



to do:
fix de inlcudes of each file
