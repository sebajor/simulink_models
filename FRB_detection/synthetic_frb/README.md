# Synthetic FRB

To test our systems we need to generate fake signals that resembles an FRB.
For that we use an Arbitrary Wave Generator controlling a Voltage controlled Oscillator to generate the dispersed curve.
Each folder is a for a difrent AWG. The main issue with the KKMoon is that you cant send a single burst they are repeated each time.
