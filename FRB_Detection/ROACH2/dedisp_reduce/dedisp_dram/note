This model has a 2048 FFT which gets reduced into a 64 FFT to match the
dedispersor size width (considering memory usage and quantity of 
dedispersors we arrive to that channel number).
Also it has multiple scopes to see the status of the spectrum after all
the re-quantization chain.

The model also has the interface with the DRAM to save the raw data when 
the dedispersor triggers a detection.
